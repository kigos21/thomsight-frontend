## About The Project

Students at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) face challenges in securing internships and preparing for careers due to limited practical experience, lack of guidance on CVs, and an overwhelming number of opportunities. THOMSIGHT is a web application designed to help UST students overcome these obstacles by offering tailored internship searches, resume-building guides, interactive community forums, and a feedback system to ensure transparency. By providing these resources, THOMSIGHT aims to boost studentsâ€™ job readiness and improve their career prospects.
